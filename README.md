# WeatherNow
The WeatherNow app is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a 5-day weather forecast for a specific area. The app consists of an HTML structure with a title, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file to handle the functionality. It leverages the OpenWeather API, which is an external weather service, to fetch the weather data.
